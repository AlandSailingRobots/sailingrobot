/*
 * Notes:
 *	The Linux I2C code is actually the same (almost) as the SMBus code.
 *	SMBus is System Management Bus - and in essentially I2C with some
 *	additional functionality added, and stricter controls on the electrical
 *	specifications, etc. however I2C does work well with it and the
 *	protocols work over both.
 *
 *	I'm directly including the SMBus functions here as some Linux distros
 *	lack the correct header files, and also some header files are GPLv2
 *	rather than the LGPL that wiringPi is released under - presumably because
 *	originally no-one expected I2C/SMBus to be used outside the kernel -
 *	however enter the Raspberry Pi with people now taking directly to I2C
 *	devices without going via the kernel...
 *
 *	This may ultimately reduce the flexibility of this code, but it won't be
 *	hard to maintain it and keep it current, should things change.
 *
 *	Information here gained from: kernel/Documentation/i2c/dev-interface
 *	as well as other online resources.
