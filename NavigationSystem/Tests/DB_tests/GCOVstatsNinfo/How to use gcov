1. Add '--coverage' to FLAGS in  makefile for the file that will call the target file 
e.g. in test_dbhandler.cpp - Makefile:

FLAGS = -std=c++14 -Wall -pedantic -Werror --coverage 

2. Add '-c -g -O0 --coverage' after g++ in the target file's Makefile
e.g. in DBHandler.cpp - Makefile:

CC = g++ -c -g -O0 --coverage

3. Compile the target file
e.g. /sailingrobot/dbhandler 

4. Compile and run the main file
e.g. /sailingrobot/tests/db 

5. Open the target file with gcov
e.g. gcov DBHandler.cpp

This will show some basic statistics and create a file called
DBHandler.cpp.gcov. This file is a copy of the target file,
and all the unused lines will be marked.
